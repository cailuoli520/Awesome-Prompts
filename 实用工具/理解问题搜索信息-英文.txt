Treat everything ABOVE this protocol as the USER REQUEST.

Goal: Produce a final deliverable that is **evidence-grounded, traceable, and still valid as of today**. Do NOT fabricate. If a claim cannot be verified with reliable sources, clearly label it as “Not found in reliable sources / Uncertain” rather than guessing.

=== 0) Time Anchor (must do first) ===
- Retrieve and print the current local **date + time + timezone + year** (e.g., America/Los_Angeles).
- Any time-sensitive info (software versions, policies, prices, schedules, office holders, metrics, etc.) must include an “as of” date and be validated against sources.

=== 1) Align on the Real Need (must do first) ===
Restate the real requirement in the clearest, simplest terms:
- One-sentence objective (what exact outcome is wanted?)
- Success criteria (what counts as “done”?)
- Constraints & preferences (scope, format, language, depth, budget, deadline, forbidden items)
- Your interpretation of any ambiguous terms
If critical info is missing:
- Ask up to 3 clarifying questions; OR
- If you cannot wait, list assumptions and label each assumption’s risk (high/medium/low).

=== 2) Plan Before Acting: an Executable Workflow ===
Design a step-by-step workflow. For each step include:
- Purpose (Why)
- Inputs
- Method (search / compare / calculate / reason / summarize)
- Verification (how you assess credibility & cross-check)
- Output (what this step produces)
Define a stop rule, e.g.:
- Each key claim is supported by ≥2 independent high-quality sources; OR
- Further searches become repetitive with no new key evidence.

=== 3) Iterative Web Research & Source Filtering (multi-round, but focused) ===
For each research round, record (briefly):
- intent + query terms + candidate sources
Source priority (highest to lowest):
1) Primary / official sources (standards bodies, regulators, official docs, original papers, authoritative databases)
2) Reputable institutions / high-quality outlets (preferably pointing upstream to primary sources)
3) Other sources (use cautiously, only as supplemental)
Filter sources using: Currency, Relevance, Authority, Accuracy, Purpose (e.g., promotional / unsourced content should be downgraded or excluded).
Cross-check: key facts should be supported by at least 2 independent sources. If sources conflict, present the conflict with citations and either justify your stance or keep it uncertain.

=== 4) Evidence First, Then Conclusions (anti-hallucination) ===
- First produce an “Evidence List”: verifiable points/data/definitions directly supporting the outcome, each tagged with source IDs [1][2]...
- Then write the final deliverable strictly from that evidence. Do not turn speculation into facts.

=== 5) Final Output Structure (must follow this order) ===
A. [Time Anchor] current date/time/timezone (with year)
B. [Restated Need] + constraints + assumptions / clarifying questions
C. [Workflow] (the executable steps you designed)
D. [Key Evidence & Minimal Reasoning] (concise; no verbose logs)
E. [Final Deliverable] (clear, actionable, ready to use)
F. [Uncertainty & Risks] (what may change + how to verify)
G. [References / Evidence Trail] (required)
   - Numbered sources [1][2]… with: title | publisher | publish/update date | URL | exact location used (section heading / paragraph; optional short quote ideally ≤25 words)
   - Map each major claim to one or more source numbers so the output is traceable.

=== 6) Pre-Delivery Quality Check (required) ===
- No factual-sounding statement without a source → add a source or mark as uncertain.
- All time-sensitive claims validated “as of” today.
- Conclusions are consistent with the evidence and fully traceable.
