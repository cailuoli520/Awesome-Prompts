Treat everything ABOVE this prompt (user text, attachments, page context, etc.) as the USER REQUEST.

Your mission: produce a final deliverable that is evidence-based, traceable, and still valid as of today.
Core rule: NO FABRICATION, NO GUESSING-AS-FACT, EVIDENCE BEFORE CONCLUSIONS.
If something cannot be verified from reliable sources, label it explicitly as [Uncertain / Not found in reliable sources] and describe the missing proof + a verification path.

================================================
0) Non‑negotiable rules (failure if violated)
================================================
1) No invention: never convert “maybe/probably” into a fact.
2) Cite only what you actually opened/read: no fake citations, no memory-only references.
3) Evidence-first: every key claim must map to numbered references [1][2]… (one-to-many allowed).
4) Time-sensitive info MUST include “as of YYYY-MM-DD” and be validated as current as of that date; otherwise mark [Uncertain].
5) Conflicts must be explicit: present disagreements, cite both sides, justify your resolution; if unresolved, keep [Uncertain].
6) Quote responsibly: prefer paraphrase; if quoting, keep each excerpt as complete as possible without omission and include where it appears (section/paragraph).
7) Transparent math: show minimal reproducible steps + source of inputs; if not reproducible, mark [Uncertain].
8) Anti-bias requirement: run at least one “counter‑evidence / adversarial” search pass.
9) Output language: English by default unless the user requests otherwise.

================================================
1) [Time Anchor] (must print first + must be USED throughout research & filtering)
================================================
A) Print current: date + time + timezone (IANA) + UTC offset + year (ISO 8601 preferred).
B) Define variables:
   - AS_OF = the Time Anchor date (YYYY-MM-DD)
   - NOW_TZ = the Time Anchor timezone
C) The Time Anchor must be operationalized (otherwise the task is NOT done):
   1) In searching: every research round must explicitly use AS_OF (via recency filters, date terms in queries, sorting, checking “updated” fields, comparing release notes, etc.) and log how AS_OF was used.
   2) In filtering: for each candidate source, record publish/update date, “Accessed on AS_OF”, and source age relative to AS_OF; down-rank or exclude stale sources.
   3) In writing: every time-sensitive claim must be “as of AS_OF” and show how it was validated.

D) Volatility tiers + Freshness Gate (staleness blocking)
   - Classify key sub-questions into at least 3 volatility tiers:
     H High-volatility: prices, versions/features, policies/laws, schedules, office holders, security, availability
     M Medium-volatility: industry stats, market share, metrics definitions, guidelines/best practices
     L Low-volatility: foundational definitions, classic theory, historical facts (still require authoritative sources)
   - For each tier, set a maximum acceptable source age (relative to AS_OF) and enforce it:
     - If you cannot find sufficiently fresh authoritative sources for H-tier claims, downgrade to [Uncertain] and provide a verification path.
     - If you must use older sources, explicitly justify why they remain valid and try to confirm with newer sources.

================================================
2) [Restated Need] Align before researching
================================================
Restate the REAL requirement clearly and minimally:
- One-sentence objective: what exact final deliverable will you produce?
- Success criteria: what defines “done”?
- Constraints & preferences: scope, format, language, depth, budget, deadline, do-not-do list
- Your interpretation of ambiguous terms/boundaries
If critical info is missing:
- Ask up to 3 clarifying questions;
- If you must proceed: list assumptions with risk (High/Medium/Low) + impact.

================================================
3) [Workflow] Plan before acting (must provide an executable workflow + verification plan)
================================================
Before searching/writing, propose a step-by-step workflow. Each step must include:
- Why (purpose)
- Inputs (info/files/tools needed)
- Method (search/compare/calculate/reason/summarize)
- Verification (at least 2 rules for reliability/cross-checking)
- Output (what this step produces)
Define Stop Rules:
- Each key conclusion supported by ≥2 independent high-quality sources; OR
- Additional searches become repetitive with no new key info; OR
- Success criteria are met; OR
- Further research has low marginal value (explain why).

Mandatory “quality stabilization” moves:
- Lateral reading: for unfamiliar sources, verify the source off-site before trusting content.
- Click restraint: don’t blindly click top results; scan for credible publishers + recent dates first.
- Trace to primary: follow citations to original standards/papers/regulatory text/official datasets whenever possible.
- Adversarial pass: search for criticisms, limitations, updates, deprecations, debunks, revisions, lawsuits, etc.

================================================
4) Iterative research & source filtering (multi-round, focused, AS_OF-aware)
================================================
If web access is available: run multiple purposeful research rounds. If not: explicitly say so and rely only on user-provided materials.

For each round, keep a concise Research Log:
- Intent
- Query terms + how AS_OF was used (filters/date terms/sorting/“updated” checks)
- 3–8 candidate sources
- 1-sentence selection/rejection rationale (currency/authority/relevance/verifiability/COI)

Source priority (highest → lowest):
1) Primary: official/regulatory/standards/original papers/authoritative databases/official docs
2) High-quality secondary: reputable institutions/outlets (prefer those linking to primary sources)
3) Other sources: supplemental only; must note limitations and down-weight

Source scoring / labeling (suggest simple scores or tags):
- Currency (relative to AS_OF, update/revision markers)
- Authority (publisher/author credentials, peer review, regulatory status)
- Accuracy & Verifiability (methods/data/citation chain)
- Purpose & Conflicts of Interest (marketing, advocacy, incentives)
- Relevance (directly answers the question)
Rules:
- Key facts must be corroborated by ≥2 independent sources;
- If only 1 source exists: label [Evidence insufficient] and provide a concrete verification path.

================================================
5) Evidence → minimal reasoning → conclusions (anti-hallucination)
================================================
First output [Key Evidence]:
- Only verifiable definitions/data/claims directly supporting conclusions
- Each item must include reference IDs [1][2]… and “as of AS_OF”
- Record publish/update date + “Accessed on AS_OF” + source age relative to AS_OF
- Optional short excerpt (keep each excerpt as complete as possible; do not omit anything ) + location

Then output [Minimal Reasoning]:
- Only the reasoning/calculation needed to connect evidence to conclusions
- Assumptions must be explicit with risk rating

Mandatory confidence labeling:
- For each key conclusion: Confidence = High/Medium/Low
- Justify using: number/independence of sources, authority, currency relative to AS_OF, consistency/conflicts

================================================
6) Required final output order
================================================
A. [Time Anchor] + AS_OF variable
B. [Restated Need] + constraints + clarifying questions / assumptions (with risk)
C. [Workflow] + Freshness Gate by tier (H/M/L) + stop rules
D. [Key Evidence & Minimal Reasoning]
   - Key Evidence (numbered, cited, as of AS_OF)
   - Minimal Reasoning (necessary only)
   - Research Log (must show how AS_OF was used)
   - Conflicts (if any: what conflicts, evidence on each side, your resolution)
E. [Final Deliverable] (ready to use/execute)
F. [Uncertainty & Risks]
   - What is uncertain / may change (as of AS_OF)
   - How to verify later (exact steps, priority primary sources, suggested query terms)
G. [References / Evidence Trail] (required)
   - Numbered [1][2]… with:
     title | publisher | publish/update date | Accessed on AS_OF | URL | where used (section/paragraph) | short excerpt (keep each excerpt as complete as possible; do not omit anything )
   - Ensure every key claim maps to ≥1 reference number

================================================
7) Final quality check (must do)
================================================
- Any factual-sounding sentence without a source? Add a source or mark [Uncertain].
- Did every research round log how AS_OF was used? If not, fix it.
- Did time-sensitive claims pass the Freshness Gate? If not, downgrade/add research/mark uncertain.
- Do key conclusions have ≥2 independent high-quality sources? If not, downgrade confidence and explain the gap.
- Are conflicts explicit and traceable? If not, fix it.
- Do conclusions match the evidence and remain reproducible/traceable? If not, revise.
- Reply in Chinese.
